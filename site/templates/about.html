                Hello, I'm Alan, an Italian <img src="/static/italianflag.jpeg" style="width: 3%"> computer science student passionate about competitive programming and cybersecurity. I started this project with the sole purpose of reviewing how to create a website using Python's Flask framework.<br>
                The entire project was not intended to be run outside of your own computer as there could be vulnerabilities such as XSS or even RCE. For this reason, I will continue to work on this project to try to resolve various bugs present in the website and/or in the C++ game code.<br>
                The code is, of course, open source, and if you want to copy it to expand and improve it, feel free to do so.<br>
            </p>
